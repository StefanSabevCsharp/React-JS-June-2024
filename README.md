# React Defense Clothing Store

This is a **React-based CRUD application** developed as part of my educational course at SoftUni. The project demonstrates a fully functional web app for managing clothing items, with features like authentication, item creation, editing, deletion, and commenting.

## 📖 **Overview**

The React Defense Clothing Store app is a platform where users can:
- View a catalog of clothing items.
- Add comments to items (available for logged-in users).
- Create new clothing items.
- Edit or delete clothing items (restricted to the author).

This project showcases my ability to build a React application with **CRUD functionality**, **user authentication**, and **state management** using **React Context**.
